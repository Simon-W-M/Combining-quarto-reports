## Main document

###Stichin' together modular reports in quarto.

A really nice way to be able to collaborate and build things on completely separate data sets.

Of course there may be shared functions, but perhaps these could also be put into a separate file.

So this is all the main document.  

We then call a version of the basic quarto report.  All I have done is remove the YAML header.

{{< include rpt2.qmd >}}

After that report I can still use standard code chunks.
```{r}
#| echo: true
2 + 2
```

And here I call another section of a report.

{{< include rpt3.qmd >}}

This method is great for building modular reports
